                                      What lies at the heart of every living thing is not a fire, not warm breath, not a ‘spark of life.’ It is information, words, instructions,” <a href="https://richarddawkins.net/">Richard Dawkins</a> declared in 1986. Already one of the world’s foremost evolutionary biologists, he had caught the spirit of a new age. The cells of an organism are nodes in a richly interwoven communications network, transmitting and receiving, coding and decoding. Evolution itself embodies an ongoing exchange of information between organism and environment. “If you want to understand life,” Dawkins wrote, “don’t think about vibrant, throbbing gels and oozes, think about information technology.”

                        We have become surrounded by information technology; our furniture includes iPods and plasma displays, and our skills include texting and Googling. But our capacity to understand the role of information has been sorely taxed. “TMI,” we say. Stand back, however, and the past does come back into focus.

                        The rise of information theory aided and abetted a new view of life. The genetic code—no longer a mere metaphor—was being deciphered. Scientists spoke grandly of the biosphere: an entity composed of all the earth’s life-forms, teeming with information, replicating and evolving. And biologists, having absorbed the methods and vocabulary of communications science, went further to make their own contributions to the understanding of information itself.

                                      Jacques Monod, the Parisian biologist who shared a Nobel Prize in 1965 for working out the role of messenger RNA in the transfer of genetic information, proposed an analogy: just as the biosphere stands above the world of nonliving matter, so an “abstract kingdom” rises above the biosphere. The denizens of this kingdom? Ideas.

                                      “<em>Ideas have retained some of the properties of organisms,” </em>he wrote. <em>“Like them, they tend to perpetuate their structure and to breed; they too can fuse, recombine, segregate their content; indeed they too can evolve, and in this evolution selection must surely play an important role.</em>”

                          Ideas have “spreading power,” he noted—“infectivity, as it were”—and some more than others. An example of an infectious idea might be a religious ideology that gains sway over a large group of people. The American neurophysiologist Roger Sperry had put forward a similar notion several years earlier, arguing that ideas are “just as real” as the neurons they inhabit. Ideas have power, he said:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Ideas cause ideas and help evolve new ideas. They interact with each other and with other mental forces in the same brain, in neighboring brains, and thanks to global communication, in far distant, foreign brains. And they also interact with the external surroundings to produce in toto a burstwise advance in evolution that is far beyond anything to hit the evolutionary scene yet.

                          Dawkins made his own jump from the evolution of genes to the evolution of ideas. For him the starring role belongs to the replicator, and it scarcely matters whether replicators were made of nucleic acid. His rule is “All life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities.” Wherever there is life, there must be replicators. Perhaps on other worlds replicators could arise in a silicon-based chemistry—or in no chemistry at all.
                        </p>
                          <p>
                            What would it mean for a replicator to exist without chemistry? “I think that a new kind of replicator has recently emerged on this very planet,” Dawkins proclaimed near the end of his first book, The Selfish Gene, in 1976. “It is staring us in the face. It is still in its infancy, still drifting clumsily about in its primeval soup, but already it is achieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves the old gene panting far behind.” That “soup” is human culture; the vector of transmission is language, and the spawning ground is the brain.

                          <p>For this bodiless replicator itself, Dawkins proposed a name. He called it the meme, and it became his most memorable invention, far more influential than his selfish genes or his later proselytizing against religiosity. “Memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation,” he wrote. They compete with one another for limited resources: brain time or bandwidth. They compete most of all for attention. For example:</p>

                          <p>  <em>Ideas.</em> Whether an idea arises uniquely or reappears many times, it may thrive in the meme pool or it may dwindle and vanish. The belief in God is an example Dawkins offers—an ancient idea, replicating itself not just in words but in music and art. The belief that Earth orbits the Sun is no less a meme, competing with others for survival. (Truth may be a helpful quality for a meme, but it is only one among many.)</p>

                      <em>Tunes.</em> This tune has spread for centuries across several continents.

                        A memetic structure is any cultural institution, space, or community in which cultural products and communication survive based on Darwinian principles, similar to that of genetics. Memes adapt, evolve, and replicate based on their strength relative to the environment they exist within. A memetic structure can be a physical space like a shopping mall or a school campus but more recently, popular culture has defined memetic structures predominantly as virtual spaces- none more infamously than the website 4chan, and in particular, its popular /b/ image board. But as the internet becomes an increasingly political entity, in the advent of the Pirate Party, Wikileaks, and Anonymous, what happens to the content of these memetic structures?

                        What role might memetics play in this radicalization of online space? The internet has always been a place for political action in small subsets and factions, but lately the “popular internet” is being retooled for political and ideological discourse by using highly accessible contemporary systems of online communication (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube). If we look at the most famous meme pool on the internet, 4chan- we now find a growing militarization and politicization of this structure; the internet-meme as a political weapon.

                          Generally, websites like 4chan have held a fairly benevolent role in popular culture. We see them as a kind of factory for bizarre trends, photoshopped images, and various other in-jokes unique to the vernacular of the web. But most of the memes that arise from this website act on or adapt previously held tropes and stereotypes within other areas of popular culture. However, as our cultural dialogue intermingles with political discourse and activism, so do our cultural products. Political activism is often relegated to a specific subset of people as a means of marginalizing dissent and keeping a movement from becoming relatable to the general public. But political discourse in the meme pool allows dissent to go viral, making it accessible to a broad audience. The mere existence of this kind of structure is an encouraging circumstance. The transmutations that happen within these spaces  lack any substantial form of hierarchy. Moderation is not imposed, it happens in generations as content is subject only to the scrutiny of populism.

                          This structure in itself is reminiscent of prefigurative politics[1]; it is a “temporary autonomous zone”, a term coined by anarchist philosopher Hakim Bey, described as an ephemeral utopia site which eludes traditional dynamics of law and hierarchy. Like Bey’s idea of a temporary autonomous zone, 4chan has no imposing will (short of rules against child pornography) and participants act without regulation or dictation from a command-hierarchy. It is unlikely that there was such a precise ideological motivation behind the creation of 4chan, rather this is an evolving potential that it holds in a broader, highly politicized meme pool.

                          We find proof of this in the adaptation of traditional internet-meme formats to explore political consciousness- conveying a broad group position on an ideological or political topic. The most apt (and most timely) example of this phenomenon is “pepper spray cop”. This meme stems from a photograph circulated of Lieutenant John Pike, a UC Davis police officer casually pepper-spraying a group of protestors. The subsequent memetic exchange involved Lt. Pike photoshopped into iconic photographs and paintings, casually pepper-spraying the subject of the images.

                        Though this meme is primarily intended to be humorous, it also serves some subtle political functions. Most obviously, it reduces the officer’s actions to absurdity as an indirect reprimand on authority gone unchecked. It offers up a kind of lasting stigma in lieu of appropriate institutional punishment. Another byproduct of this meme is the transmission of a political dialogue through media that would otherwise not allow for it. If one person, motivated politically shares a “pepper spray cop” image with another person who has no political motivation- this second person might still share the image for comedic effect.

                          This kind of encryption allows for continued potency of a political message despite the fact that viewers may be sharing it for a myriad of different reasons.  Though this is a more common circumstance of political action within the meme pool, in its current state, it is not the most effective. But as political engagement coincides more and more with internet culture, memes that bear an ideological motive will require less cryptography to have their message travel and subsequently, will become more potent and useful over time. Just as the most ardent watchdog of police and military force is now viral video- the same principle might hold true for the replication and transmutation of political discourse- populism will find its root in a decentralized form of memetic exchange. A public voice can be found in this kind of humorous dialogue- and in many ways, it might carry a more immediate reaction than any of its institutional alternatives.

                          The popular internet-meme is a vessel with any number of purposes, and by definition, accessible enough to engage a wide variety of audiences. This alone is not enough to curry any kind of substantive political or social change, but it sets up a structure that allows for immediate input and dialogue on matters normally outside the reach of an empowered public- it offers the chance for political commentary to transfer to political progress. In organizing ideas and dialogues in this method, we allow for a more open approach to social change and lay out a framework with which we might potentially shape cultural nuances through the web. The tools are accessible, and the content survives based on merit and relevancy. There is an ever-broadening arsenal of political engagement but few methods of immediate popular commentary permeate through our culture as effortlessly as the internet meme.

                          <p>
People use social media to discuss what's happening at work, whether it's dealing with technical issues, spending time in meetings and conference calls, or discussing the strategic direction of their company. A pair of IBM researchers wrote about an instance of this workplace chatter, and how businesses could improve – if they're listening.

                          <em>What is a meme?</em>
                          <p>
Biologist Richard Dawkins first used the term meme (meem) in his book The Selfish Gene – as a parallel to genes – "to refer to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator, such as songs or fashion." In November 2011, two IBM employees started #stuffibmerssay on Twitter. The short-lived
meme of a little more than 3,000 tweets by 725 participants highlighted in a humorous way — things that sometimes frustrate IBMers: work-related procedures, technology failures, conference call behaviors, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          On the surface, it may have seemed that the hashtag reflected nothing more than
                          employees joking openly (and potentially creating headache for management), yet the content of the tweets provided something more - real insights into the culture of the company.

                          "#Stuffibmerssay reflected what it's like to work at almost any large corporation. Employees are naturally talking about these things online; employers should learn from them," said Dr. Jennifer Thom, a research scientist with IBM's Collaborative End User Experience Group. Thom and colleague David Millen wrote Stuff IBMers Say: Microblogs as an Expression of Organizational Culture.

                            3,085 tweets, 725 participants, 29% was commentary about work related procedures, 17% were jokes and banter about IBM, 12% called out internal technology failures, 11% made observations about conference calls behaviors and norms, 4% characterized details about non-standard offices and global location of teams

                          Paying attention to what employees say in social media could help businesses improve IT support, find out what initiatives are working (or not), and even provide a way for company leadership to join the conversation. Internal social networks and policies within a company can also play a role. In the instance of #stuffibmerssay, rank-and-file employees along with corporate and human resource managers internally discussed the hashtag (determining that it was well within IBM's social computing guidelines.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          While mining through the data of the conversations can help companies improve their business practices, these types of conversations have benefits for the employees engaging in them. IBMers who participated in the meme reported that it helped them feel a sense of belonging – even though participants came from a variety of job roles and lived across India, the United States, the UK, Australia and other countries.

Employees have moved water cooler talk online. Now, colleagues from any job role or location can share bits about daily company life, and those bits can become useful insights.
Not every office topic needs to have a trending meme on Twitter to be important. Social listening can still help human resources pin point job satisfaction issues, and even give management a way to solve problems within online conversations – multiple conference calls not withstanding.</p>

  The Internet is a bastion of folk culture. Insider slang, chain emails, and trendy videos fill inboxes and news feeds, circulating from user to user. If someone uploads a photo of her cat, another adds a poorly-spelled caption and posts it to a message board, and months (or years) later, someone else changes the caption, this string of reappropriated words and images is called a “meme,” in Internet parlance. The term is vague enough to encompass such varied digital artifacts as Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” music video, collections of funny yearbook quotes, and animated GIFs of a dancing hamster. Memes reveal much about what communications scholar Henry Jenkins refers to as the participatory culture of the Internet, which is constantly in flux.

                          According to Patrick Davison, “an Internet meme is a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence through online transmission.” Limor Schifman defines them as “cultural information that passes along from person to person, yet gradually scales into a shared social phenomenon.” The availability of social media means that any piece of Internet content has the potential for an enormous audience. Websites like Know Your Meme chronicle popular Internet trends almost as quickly as they emerge.

                          <p>
The term “meme” was coined by evolutionary biologist (and famed atheist) Richard Dawkins in his 1976 bestseller The Selfish Gene. Though the book is mainly concerned with the propagation of genetic material, Dawkins briefly turned his attention to the propagation of cultural material. He observed that fashion and customs evolve rapidly, resembling the ways genes evolve. Curious as to how such influential norms could change so quickly, Dawkins broke cultural products down into units called memes, including “tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches.” Just as genes propagate themselves by leaping from body to body, he wrote, so “memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation.”
                          </p>

    Dawkins identified three key elements of a successful genetic variant: copy-fidelity, fecundity, and longevity. In relation to memes, copy-fidelity is the ability to replicate accurately; fecundity is its speed of replication; and longevity its stability over time. Certain memes, he said, will be more successful than others because they fulfill a cultural need or are uniquely suited to a specific circumstance.

                    Drunk BabyContemporary memes can be roughly divided into two groups. A study of YouTube memes by Shifman distinguishes between “viral videos” (for instance, the video for Korean pop star Psy’s “Gangnam Style,” which was a huge hit in his home country and became a world-wide phenomenon on the Internet) and “memetic videos,” which spur “extensive creative user engagement in the form of parody, pastiche, mash-ups or other derivative work.” Davison calls the former “big like McDonald’s” (something enjoyed by many, but not co-created) vs. “big like Emoji” the popular pictographic language built into iPhones and used in new and creative ways by text-aficionados. In other words, while some memes are just trendy pictures or videos that get passed around verbatim, others encourage a type of iteration, imitation, parody, and satire that can spawn literally thousands of variants. Memes, then, can become raw material for creativity. Think of the myriad “image macros” that let anyone slap a funny caption on the same image, or people uploading YouTube videos of themselves enacting the latest dance craze (the Harlem Shake, twerking, or even elaborate, choreographed wedding dances).

              Memes harness what are really the “key logics,” as Shifman puts it, of online culture: sociability, replicability, and participation. They spread, according to Claudia Leigh, via a social, affective bond, and circulate through everyday communication channels like Facebook or Gchat. Memes harness the participatory potential of the Internet and typify modern popular culture.

              Studying Internet chain letters, dance crazes, catchphrases, and slideshows of cute dogs may seem trivial, much as studying television or pop music did a generation ago. But media scholars believe memes typify the shift from a culture of consumption to one of production. While teenagers might once have spent their free time watching television, a young person today may get creative, using their laptop and Wi-Fi to overlay witty text on a photo of a cat. Though it’s not exactly intense intellectual labor, media scholar Clay Shirky is clear: even lolcats constitute creative work. Memes are the closest thing to a native cultural form the Internet has, and, as such, they demonstrate the sprawling variety of the medium.
