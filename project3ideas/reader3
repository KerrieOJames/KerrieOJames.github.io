                                  <p>In Te Future of the Internet—and How to Stop It, <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/jonathan_zittrain">Jonathan Zittrain</a>
                      describes the features of a generative network. A generative network encourages
                      and enables creative production and, as a system, possesses leverage,
                      adaptability, ease of mastery, accessibility, and transferability.1
                       Notably absent from this list of characteristics, however, is security.

                                  <p>  Many of the characteristics
                          that make a system generative are precisely the same ones that leave it
                          vulnerable to exploitation. This zero-sum game between creativity and security
                          implies a divided Internet. Those platforms and communities which value
                          security over creativity can be thought of as the “restricted web,” while those
                          that remain generative in the face of other concerns are the <a href "https://creativecommons.org/2017/04/06/global-coalition-pushes-unrestricted-sharing-scholarly-citation-data/">“unrestricted web.”</a>

                                  <p>   The restricted web has its poster children. <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691612442904">Facebook</a> and other social networking
                          sites are growing at incredible speeds. Google and its ever-expanding
                          corral of applications are slowly assimilating solutions to all our computing
                          needs. <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/">Amazon</a> and similar search-based commerce sites are creating
                          previously <a href="http://longtail.com/about.html/">unimagined economies</a>. Metaphorically, these sites, and countless
                      others, make up the cities and public works of the restricted web. However,
                      the unrestricted web remains the wilderness all around them, and it is
                      this wilderness that is the native habitat of Internet memes.

                        The purpose of this essay is twofold. The frst is to contribute to a framework
            for discussing so-called Internet memes. Internet memes are popular
            and recognizable but lack a rigorous descriptive vocabulary. I provide a few
            terms to aid in their discussion. The second purpose is to consider <a href="http://www.michel-foucault.com/">Foucault’s</a>
            "<a href="http://arthistoryunstuffed.com/michel-foucault-what-author/">author function</a>" relative to Internet memes, many of which are created and
            spread anonymously.

                        What Is an Internet Meme?

                        In 1979 Richard Dawkins published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9p2F2oa0_k">The Selfsh Gene</a>, in which he discredits
                  the idea that living beings are genetically compelled to behave in ways that
                  are “good for the species.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> accomplishes this by making one point clear: the basic units of genetics are not species, families, or even individuals
                  but rather single genes—unique strands of DNA.3

                      <p>
                        At the end of the book, Dawkins discusses two areas where evolutionary
              theory might be heading next. It is here that he coins the term “meme.” He
              acknowledges that much of human behavior comes not from genes but from
              culture. He proposes that any nongenetic behavior be labeled as a meme and
              then poses a question: can the application of genetic logic to memes be productive?
              To make the diferences between genes and memes clear, I offer a
              short example of each.

                      <p>
                        Genes determine an organism’s physical characteristics. A certain gene
            causes an organism to have short legs, or long, for instance. Imagine two
            zebra. The frst has the short-leg gene, and the second the long. A lion attacks
            them. The short-legged zebra runs more slowly and is eaten. The long-legged
            zebra runs more quickly (because of its legs) and lives. At this point, there
            are more long-leg genes in the imaginary ecosystem than short-leg genes.
            If the long-legged zebra breeds and has ofspring, those ofspring with long
            legs will continue to survive at a higher rate, and more ofspring of those ofspring
            will contain the long-leg gene. The genes themselves are not thinking
            beings—the long-leg gene does not know it causes long-leggedness, nor does
            it care, but given that it bestows a property that interacts with the environment
            to allow more of itself to be produced, it is successful.

                        Memes determine the behavior of an organism. They are either taught to
            an organism (you go to school and learn math) or learned through experience
            (you stick a fnger in an outlet, get shocked, understand that outlets
            should be avoided). Imagine two soccer players. There are genetic factors
            which might make them better or worse at playing (long or short legs, for
            instance); however, their ability is also dependent on their understanding of
            the game. For this example, let us imagine that the two players are physically
            identical. However, one of them goes to practice, and the other does not. At
            practice, the coach teaches the attendant player about passing: you pass the
            ball to other players and increase the chance that your team will score. During
            a game, the attendant player is likely to pass and to experience success
            because of it. The truant player, having not learned the passing meme, will
            not pass, and that player’s team will sufer because of it

                        While genes rely on the physical process of reproduction to replicate,
                      memes rely on the mental processes of observation and learning. In our
                      example, the truant player comes to the game without the passing meme and
                      sufers. That player is, however, able to observe the attendant player passing,
                      and succeeding, and can decide to imitate the attendant player by passing as
                      well. The passing meme successfully replicates itself in a new organism without
                      the all-or-nothing cycle of life and death. This highlights one of the critical
                      differences between genes and memes: speed of transmission. Compared
                      to genetic changes (which span generations upon generations), memetic
                      changes happen in the blink of an eye. Offline memes, cultural cornerstones
                      like language or religion, are hyperfast when compared to their genetic counterparts.
                      Internet memes are even faster.

                        The other notable difference between genes and memes is their relative
fidelity of form. In our zebra example, a zebra is granted physical characteristics
based on a discrete combination of DNA. All the genes that Dawkins discusses
are at their most basic made up of sequences of only four chemicals.
The memes that I examine in this essay, however, are not made up of chemicals
but of ideas and concepts. Our truant player may observe and learn
the passing meme, but that process does not transfer an identical chemical
“code” for passing. The meme is subject to interpretation and therefore to
variation.

                        In <a href="https://richarddawkins.net/">Dawkins’s</a> original framing, memes described any cultural idea or
  behavior. Fashion, language, religion, sports—all of these are memes. Today,
  though, the term “meme”—or specifcally “Internet meme”—has a new, colloquial
  meaning. While memes themselves have been the subject of entire
  books, modern Internet memes lack even an accurate defnition. There are
  numerous online sources (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/">Urban Dictionary</a>, <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/">Know Your Meme</a>,
  <a href="https://encyclopediadramatica.rs/Main_Page">Encyclopedia Dramatica</a>) that describe Internet memes as the public perceives
  them, but none does so in an academically rigorous way. Given this, I
  have found the following new defnition to be useful in the consideration of
  Internet memes specifcally:
  <br>
  <br>
  <em>An Internet meme is a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains infuence
  through online transmission.</em>

                        While not all Internet memes are jokes, comparing them to offline jokes
  makes it clear what makes Internet memes unique: the speed of their transmission
  and the fdelity of their form.5
   A spoken joke, for instance, can only
  be transmitted as quickly as those individuals who know it can move from
  place to place, and its form must be preserved by memory. A printed joke,
  in contrast, can be transmitted by moving paper and can be preserved by a
  physical arrangement of ink. The speed of transmission is no longer limited
  by the movement of individuals, and the form of the joke is preserved by a
  medium, not memory.

                      <p>
                        Now, consider a joke that exists on the Internet. The speed of transmission
    is increased yet again, in an incredible way. Space is overcome: computers
    connect to one another through far-reaching networks. Time is overcome:
    the digitally represented information is available as long as the server
    hosting it remains online. A joke stored on a website can be viewed by as
    many people as want to view it, as many times as they want to, as quickly as
    they can request it.
  </p>
  <p>
    An online joke’s fidelity of form, however, is subject to a unique contradiction.
    Being digital, the joke is perfectly replicable. Copy and paste functions (or their
    equivalents) are ubiquitous, expected parts of sofware platforms.
     However, a piece of digital media in the modern landscape of robust and varied manipulation
    sofware renders it also perfectly malleable. Individual sections of a piece of
    digital media can be lifted, manipulated, and reapplied with little effort.

                        Once I say that a piece of media, or a meme, is replicable and malleable, I
must specify what <em>exactly</em> is being copied or changed. A meme can be separated
into components. I propose three: the manifestation, the behavior, and
the ideal.
</p>
<p>
The <em>manifestation</em> of a meme is its observable, external phenomena. It is
the set of objects created by the meme, the records of its existence. It indicates
any arrangement of physical particles in time and space that are the
direct result of the reality of the meme.
</p>
<p>
The <em>behavior</em> of a meme is the action taken by an individual in service of
the meme. The behavior of the meme creates the manifestation. For instance,
if the behavior is photographing a cat and manipulating that photograph
with sofware, the manifestation this creates is the ordered progression of
pixels subsequently uploaded to the Internet.
</p>
<p>
  The <em>ideal</em> of a meme is the concept or idea conveyed. The ideal dictates
the behavior, which in turn creates the manifestation. If the manifestation is
a funny image of a cat and the behavior is using sofware to make it, then the
ideal is something like “cats are funny.”

                      <p>
                        When tracking the spread of a particular meme, it is useful to identify which
      of these three aspects is being replicated and which adapted. Dawkins prefigures
      this in his original chapter by theorizing that the principal tool for meme
      identifcation would be the perception of replication. This is important, because
      identifying the replication of memes is subjective. Sometimes this identifcation
      is easy: one person acts, and another person copies that person exactly.
      Other times the process of replication is less exact. This is why separating the
      manifestation, behavior, and ideal is useful. As long as one of the three components
      is passed on, the meme is replicating, even if mutating and adapting.

                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_phenomena">EARLY INTERNET MEMES</a>
                        <p>
In 1982 Scott E. Fahlman proposed a solution to a problem he and other users
were experiencing when communicating via the Internet. Members who participated
on the bulletin-board system at Carnegie Mellon would on occasion
descend into “fame wars”—long threads of communication that are hostile
or openly aggressive to other users. Fahlman believed that many of these
disagreements arose out of misinterpreted humor. His solution to this problem
was to add a specifc marker to the end of any message that was a joke.
That marker was :-). I am going to assume that anyone reading this has seen
this “emoticon” and understands that if rotated ninety degrees clockwise, the
colon, hyphen, and close-parenthesis resemble a smiling face, a symbol lifed
from pre-Internet time. Tis practice of contextualizing one’s written messages
with an emoticon to indicate emotional intent has become widespread. Today
there are countless other pseudopictograms of expressions and objects which
are regularly added to typed communication. Emoticons are a meme.

                      <p>
                        To leverage my framework, the manifestation of an emoticon is whatever
combination of typed characters is employed as pseudopictogram. These can
be in any medium—handwritten or printed on paper, displayed on a screen,
any form capable of representing glyphs. The behavior is the act of constructing
such an emoticon to contribute emotional meaning to a text. The ideal is
that small combinations of recognizable glyphs represent the intent or emotional
state of the person transmitting them.
</p>
<p>
If we analyze the emoticon meme from a genetic point of view which
values survival and defnes success through continued replication, it proves
itself remarkably well situated. Emoticons can be very quickly used. Emoticons
are easy to experiment with. The tools for making emoticons are
included on every device we use to type. Te primary glyphs used for many
of the emoticons are glyphs used less ofen than the upper- and lower-case
alphabets. Emoticons reference a previously existing source of meaning
(human facial expressions) and therefore can be easily interpreted upon frst
encounter. More than just re-creating face-to-face meaning in textual communication,
emoticons also add the possibility of a new level of meaning—a
level impossible without them.

                        If all these factors were not true, perhaps emoticons would see less use. If
keyboards full of punctuation were not already spread across the landscape,
or if human facial expressions were not a cultural constant, maybe emoticons
would disappear or be relegated to obscurity. As it stands, though, emoticons not only pervade both online and ofine communication but have also
received signifcant formal support on many platforms.

Emoticons come from the Internet’s childhood, when bulletin boards
and e-mails accounted for a bulk of the activity online. Another early meme
came from its adolescence—1998, afer the widespread adoption of the World
Wide Web and during the heyday of GeoCities. Deidre LaCarte, who was a
Canadian art student at the time, made a GeoCities-hosted website as part of
a contest with a friend to see who could generate the most online traffic. The
website she created, popularly known as “<a href="http://www.hamsterdance.org/hamsterdance/">Hamster Dance</a>,” consisted of row
upon row of animated gifs, each one depicting a hamster dancing, all set to
a distorted nine-second audio loop. As of January 1999 the site had amassed
eight hundred views, total. Once 1999 began, however, without warning or
clear cause, the site began to log as many as ffeen thousand views a day.11
The comparison of these two early memes, Hamster Dance and emoticons,
provides an opportunity to expand and clarify some of the vocabulary I use
to discuss memes and to make two important distinctions.

                        Emoticons are a meme that serve a number of functions in the transmission
of information. Tey can be used to frame content as positive or negative,
serious or joking, or any number of other things. Hamster Dance essentially
serves a single function: to entertain. Tis diference in function infuences the
primary modes of access for each of these memes. For the emoticon meme the
behavior is to construct any number of emotional glyphs in any number of settings,
while for the Hamster Dance meme the behavior is only a single thing:
have people (themselves or others) view the Hamster Dance web page. Te
Hamster Dance page is a singular thing, a spectacle. It gains infuence through
its surprising centralization. It is a piece of content that seems unsuited given
more traditional models of assessment of organizing people around a central
location, but yet, that is precisely the function it serves.
Emoticons gain infuence in exactly the opposite way. Tere was an original,
single emoticon typed in 1982, but other emoticons do not drive people
toward that single iteration. Te emoticon has gained infuence not by
being surprisingly centralized but by being surprisingly distributed. Hamster
Dance is big like Mt. Rushmore. Emoticons are big like McDonald’s. Tis
frst distinction, then, is that the infuence gained by memes can be both centralized
and distributed.
