              A memetic structure can be a physical space like a shopping mall or a school campus but more recently, popular culture has defined memetic structures predominantly as virtual spaces- none more infamously than the website <a href="https://www.4chan.org/"> 4chan</a>, and in particular, its popular image board. But as the internet becomes an increasingly political entity, in the advent of the <a href="https://pirateparty.org.au">Pirate Party<a>, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/">Wikileaks</a>, and <a href="http://anonofficial.com/">Anonymous</a>, what happens to the content of these memetic structures?

              What role might memetics play in this radicalization of online space? The internet has always been a place for political action in small subsets and factions, but lately the “popular internet” is being retooled for political and ideological discourse by using highly accessible contemporary systems of online communication (Twitter, Facebook, Youtube). If we look at the most famous meme pool on the internet, 4chan- we now find a growing militarization and politicization of this structure; the internet-meme as a political weapon.

                In Te Future of the Internet—and How to Stop It, Jonathan Zittrain
                describes the features of a generative network. A generative network encourages
                and enables creative production and, as a system, possesses leverage,
                adaptability, ease of mastery, accessibility, and transferability.1
                 Notably absent
                from this list of characteristics, however, is security.

          Generally, websites like 4chan have held a fairly benevolent role in popular culture. We see them as a kind of factory for bizarre trends, photoshopped images, and various other in-jokes unique to the vernacular of the web. But most of the memes that arise from this website act on or adapt previously held tropes and stereotypes within other areas of popular culture. However, as our cultural dialogue intermingles with political discourse and activism, so do our cultural products.
