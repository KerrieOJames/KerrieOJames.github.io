            <p>In Te Future of the Internet—and How to Stop It, Jonathan Zittrain
describes the features of a generative network. A generative network encourages
and enables creative production and, as a system, possesses leverage,
adaptability, ease of mastery, accessibility, and transferability.1
 Notably absent from this list of characteristics, however, is security. </P>

              Many of the characteristics
    that make a system generative are precisely the same ones that leave it
    vulnerable to exploitation. Tis zero-sum game between creativity and security
    implies a divided Internet. Tose platforms and communities which value
    security over creativity can be thought of as the “restricted web,” while those
    that remain generative in the face of other concerns are the “unrestricted web.”

              Te restricted web has its poster children. Facebook and other social networking
    sites are growing at incredible speeds. Google and its ever-expanding
    corral of applications are slowly assimilating solutions to all our computing
    needs. Amazon and similar search-based commerce sites are creating
    previously <a href="http://longtail.com/about.html/">unimagined economies</a>. Metaphorically, these sites, and countless
others, make up the cities and public works of the restricted web. However,
the unrestricted web remains the wilderness all around them, and it is
this wilderness that is the native habitat of Internet memes.

            <p>
              The purpose of this essay is twofold. Te frst is to contribute to a framework
  for discussing so-called Internet memes. Internet memes are popular
  and recognizable but lack a rigorous descriptive vocabulary. I provide a few
  terms to aid in their discussion. Te second purpose is to consider Foucault’s
  “author function” relative to Internet memes, many of which are created and
  spread anonymously.

            What Is an Internet Meme?

            In 1979 Richard Dawkins published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9p2F2oa0_k">The Selfsh Gene</a>, in which he discredits
      the idea that living beings are genetically compelled to behave in ways that
      are “good for the species.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> accomplishes this by making one point clear: the basic units of genetics are not species, families, or even individuals
      but rather single genes—unique strands of DNA.3

            At the end of the book, Dawkins discusses two areas where evolutionary
  theory might be heading next. It is here that he coins the term “meme.” He
  acknowledges that much of human behavior comes not from genes but from
  culture. He proposes that any nongenetic behavior be labeled as a meme and
  then poses a question: can the application of genetic logic to memes be productive?
  To make the diferences between genes and memes clear, I ofer a
  short example of each.

            Genes determine an organism’s physical characteristics. A certain gene
causes an organism to have short legs, or long, for instance. Imagine two
zebra. The frst has the short-leg gene, and the second the long. A lion attacks
them. The short-legged zebra runs more slowly and is eaten. The long-legged
zebra runs more quickly (because of its legs) and lives. At this point, there
are more long-leg genes in the imaginary ecosystem than short-leg genes.
If the long-legged zebra breeds and has ofspring, those ofspring with long
legs will continue to survive at a higher rate, and more ofspring of those ofspring
will contain the long-leg gene. The genes themselves are not thinking
beings—the long-leg gene does not know it causes long-leggedness, nor does
it care, but given that it bestows a property that interacts with the environment
to allow more of itself to be produced, it is successful.

            Memes determine the behavior of an organism. They are either taught to
an organism (you go to school and learn math) or learned through experience
(you stick a fnger in an outlet, get shocked, understand that outlets
should be avoided). Imagine two soccer players. There are genetic factors
which might make them better or worse at playing (long or short legs, for
instance); however, their ability is also dependent on their understanding of
the game. For this example, let us imagine that the two players are physically
identical. However, one of them goes to practice, and the other does not. At
practice, the coach teaches the attendant player about passing: you pass the
ball to other players and increase the chance that your team will score. During
a game, the attendant player is likely to pass and to experience success
because of it. The truant player, having not learned the passing meme, will
not pass, and that player’s team will sufer because of it

              While genes rely on the physical process of reproduction to replicate,
            memes rely on the mental processes of observation and learning. In our
            example, the truant player comes to the game without the passing meme and
            sufers. That player is, however, able to observe the attendant player passing,
            and succeeding, and can decide to imitate the attendant player by passing as
            well. The passing meme successfully replicates itself in a new organism without
            the all-or-nothing cycle of life and death. Tis highlights one of the critical
            diferences between genes and memes: speed of transmission. Compared
            to genetic changes (which span generations upon generations), memetic
            changes happen in the blink of an eye. Ofine memes, cultural cornerstones
            like language or religion, are hyperfast when compared to their genetic counterparts.
            Internet memes are even faster.

            A memetic structure is any cultural institution, space, or community in which cultural products and communication survive based on Darwinian principles, similar to that of genetics. Memes adapt, evolve, and replicate based on their strength relative to the environment they exist within.

        Generally, websites like 4chan have held a fairly benevolent role in popular culture. We see them as a kind of factory for bizarre trends, photoshopped images, and various other in-jokes unique to the vernacular of the web. But most of the memes that arise from this website act on or adapt previously held tropes and stereotypes within other areas of popular culture. However, as our cultural dialogue intermingles with political discourse and activism, so do our cultural products.
