            <p>In Te Future of the Internet—and How to Stop It, Jonathan Zittrain
describes the features of a generative network. A generative network encourages
and enables creative production and, as a system, possesses leverage,
adaptability, ease of mastery, accessibility, and transferability.1
 Notably absent from this list of characteristics, however, is security. </P>

              Many of the characteristics
    that make a system generative are precisely the same ones that leave it
    vulnerable to exploitation. Tis zero-sum game between creativity and security
    implies a divided Internet. Tose platforms and communities which value
    security over creativity can be thought of as the “restricted web,” while those
    that remain generative in the face of other concerns are the “unrestricted web.”

              Te restricted web has its poster children. Facebook and other social networking
    sites are growing at incredible speeds. Google and its ever-expanding
    corral of applications are slowly assimilating solutions to all our computing
    needs. Amazon and similar search-based commerce sites are creating
    previously <a href="http://longtail.com/about.html/">unimagined economies</a>. Metaphorically, these sites, and countless
others, make up the cities and public works of the restricted web. However,
the unrestricted web remains the wilderness all around them, and it is
this wilderness that is the native habitat of Internet memes.

            <p>
              Te purpose of this essay is twofold. Te frst is to contribute to a framework
  for discussing so-called Internet memes. Internet memes are popular
  and recognizable but lack a rigorous descriptive vocabulary. I provide a few
  terms to aid in their discussion. Te second purpose is to consider Foucault’s
  “author function” relative to Internet memes, many of which are created and
  spread anonymously.

            What Is an Internet Meme?

            In 1979 Richard Dawkins published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9p2F2oa0_k">The Selfsh Gene</a>, in which he discredits
      the idea that living beings are genetically compelled to behave in ways that
      are “good for the species.” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins">Dawkins</a> accomplishes this by making one point clear: the basic units of genetics are not species, families, or even individuals
      but rather single genes—unique strands of DNA.3

            A memetic structure is any cultural institution, space, or community in which cultural products and communication survive based on Darwinian principles, similar to that of genetics. Memes adapt, evolve, and replicate based on their strength relative to the environment they exist within.

        Generally, websites like 4chan have held a fairly benevolent role in popular culture. We see them as a kind of factory for bizarre trends, photoshopped images, and various other in-jokes unique to the vernacular of the web. But most of the memes that arise from this website act on or adapt previously held tropes and stereotypes within other areas of popular culture. However, as our cultural dialogue intermingles with political discourse and activism, so do our cultural products.
