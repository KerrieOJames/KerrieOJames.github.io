		A
		<strong>butcher </strong>
		<br>
		was
		<br>
		opening
		<br>
		his
		<br>
		market
		<br>
		one
		<br>
		morning
		<br>
		and
		<br>
		as
		<br>
		he
		<br>
		did
		<br>
		a
		<br>
		<em>rabbit</em>
		<br>
		popped
		<br>
		his
		<br>
		head
		<br>
		through
		<br>
		the
		<br>
		door.
		<br>
		The
		<br>
		<strong>butcher</strong>
		<br>
		was
		<br>
		<h3>surprised</h3>
		when
		<br>
		the
		<br>
		rabbit
		<br>
		inquired
		<br>
		“Got
		<br>
		any
		<br>
		<em>cabbage?”</em>
